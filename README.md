# demigod-mods

This is a collection of mods for the game Demigod, all of which should be compatible with each other.

BalanceMod, Enhanced AI, Enhanced UI and Uberfix are part of Pacov's old mod package and are included in his installer (Demigod Mod Installer.exe). These are the ones mostly used in multiplayer games.

Most of these mods are not mine (except IncreasedLevel-30 and I suppose CloakOfInvisibility), so if anybody minds them being uploaded here, feel free to contact me.

There's also an [Extended BalanceMod](https://github.com/Schwiegerknecht/ExtendedBalanceMod) which has its own repo, in case you're interested.

Note: FavorMod will be added at a later date.

## Installation

To install a mod, take the corresponding folder, e.g. "Enhanced AI", localize your Demigod path and copy the mod folder into
`..\Demigod\bindata\mods`.

If you download the mods as a .zip, make sure you don't unpack them into an extra folder. If you have a folder structure like `..\Demigod\bindata\mods\Enhanced AI\Enhanced AI` it will lead to crashes in multiplayer.

You need to restart your game before being able to use a freshly installed mod.
