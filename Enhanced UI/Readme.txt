The enhanced UI Mod

This mod is simply a collection of several talented modders work.  The only benefit of this combined package is that you only need to enable 1 mod to get the benefit of the 4 most commonly used mods

The mod package includes:
- Always visible health mana xp text by gunblob.  This mod makes your health, mana, and xp meters always show the text value as well (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/369556)
- Bman's Godlike Team Panel v1.2.3 by bman654.  This creates an overlay menu showing your teammates stats (hp/mana) (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/369937)
- Bman's Rampaging Minion Overlay 0.6 by bman654.  This creates an overlay menu showing minion stats (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/370227)
- Rollover Ally Info v1.4.5 by Chirmaya (1.4.5 updated by pacov).  This enables you to move your mouse over a player on your team and see what items they have.  Very useful for knowing if a teammate has a sigil, etc. (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/400449)
- Enhanced squelch/chat v1.0 by mithy.  This mod simplifies the in game squelch/muting system and provides enhancements to the chat system.  Type /? in chat in game to see a list of commands (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/409561)

Notes:
These are user-interface (ui) mods and do not require everyone to have the mods installed.

How to Enable:
First, be sure to disable any of the individual UI mods if you had them installed previously.  You can do this under the mod manager when Demigod is running.  Then, simply enable the Enhanced UI mod in the mod manager.  I'd recommend deleting the original mods completely (delete any of the following mods if you have them installed:  always visible health and mana text, bman godlike team panel, bman rampaging minion overlay, rollover ally info, and rollover ally info perfected).   

If you have problems, make sure that your directory setup is akin to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Stardock Games\Demigod\bindata\mods\Enhanced UI\
